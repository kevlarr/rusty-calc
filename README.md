# Rusty Calculator

<sub>Or, *A Pointlessly Complex Calculator Prompt*</sub>

An exercise in learning Rust via developing a mathematical expression parser as well as
arithmetic operations that evaluate solely through artificial logic gates and circuits.

With Rust 1.29.0 and `cargo` installed:

1. `git clone https://github.com/kevlarr/rusty-calc`
2. `cd rusty-calc`
3. `cargo run`
4. Make fun of it

## TODO

### Expression parsing

- [x] Parse simple binary arithmetic operations
- [x] Support operator precedence without requiring parentheses
- [x] Support nested expressions via parentheses
- [x] Expression evaluation via built-in operators
- [ ] Expression evaluation via artificial circuits

### Artificial circuits
- [x] Add
- [x] Subtract
- [x] Multiply
- [x] Divide
- [ ] Exponentiation
- [ ] Modulus
