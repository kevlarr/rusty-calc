# Rusty Calculator

<sub>Or, *A Pointlessly Complex Calculator Prompt*</sub>

An exercise in learning the basics of Rust as well as exploring the
"circuitry" underlying binary math using booleans and simulated logic gates.

With Rust 1.29.0 and `cargo` installed:

1. `git clone https://github.com/kevlarr/rusty-calc`
2. `cd rusty-calc`
3. `cargo run`
4. Make fun of it

## TODO

- [x] Add
- [x] Subtract
- [x] Multiply
- [ ] Divide
- [ ] Exponentiation?
